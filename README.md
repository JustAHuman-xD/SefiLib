# SefiLib
This library was made to store some of the more common functions, classes and tools I have used throughout all of my released addons. 
I am sharing this with the commuinity in the hopes to help others with their own development, allowing devs to skip writing things I have already made in the past.

Further information about usage and the project's java docs can be found at:
